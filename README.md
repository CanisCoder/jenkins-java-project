# Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline

This repository contains the Jenkins pipeline configuration for automating the build, test, and deployment process of our web application.

## Overview

[Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/) is an open-source automation server that helps automate the software development process, including building, testing, and deploying applications. In this repository, we've set up a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins to streamline our development workflow.

## Pipeline Structure

Our Jenkins pipeline is structured as follows:

- **Source Code Management**: We use the Git plugin to connect Jenkins to our GitHub repository, allowing Jenkins to pull the latest code changes for every build.
  
- **Build**: The build stage involves compiling the code, running tests, and packaging the application. We have configured Jenkins to execute build steps defined in the Jenkinsfile.
  
- **Deploy**: After a successful build, the pipeline deploys the application to a testing environment. We utilize Docker for containerization and Kubernetes for orchestration in our deployment process.
  
- **Automated Testing**: We integrate automated testing frameworks such as Selenium for UI testing and JUnit for unit testing to ensure the quality of our application.
  
- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: The pipeline is triggered automatically whenever changes are pushed to the repository, ensuring that every code change is validated and integrated into the mainline.
  
- **Continuous Deployment (CD)**: Optionally, we can set up automatic deployment to production after successful testing in the staging environment.

## Getting Started

To set up the Jenkins pipeline locally or in your own Jenkins instance, follow these steps:

1. **Install Jenkins**: Download and install Jenkins from the [official website](https://www.jenkins.io/download/) or set it up using Docker.
  
2. **Install Required Plugins**: Ensure that the necessary plugins like Git, Docker, Kubernetes, etc., are installed in your Jenkins instance.
  
3. **Configure Jenkins**: Set up Jenkins configuration, including credentials, global settings, and node configurations.
  
4. **Create Pipeline Job**: Create a new pipeline job in Jenkins and configure it to use the Jenkinsfile provided in this repository.
  
5. **Run Pipeline**: Trigger the pipeline manually or set up webhooks to automatically trigger the pipeline on code changes.
